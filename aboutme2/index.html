Greetings Web Programmers!
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This was an assignment for RubyLearning Web Programming. It's a static page running on github pages.</p>

<p>I'm running an old HP laptop that my sister gave me. It has Windows 10 not active but free.<br/>
I had a Dell that I got from my sister untill it got zapped by lightning.</p>
<p>I have worked with Linux before but I don't have anything running except the Ubuntu that is now for MS Windows<br/>
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about">Bash on Ubuntu on Windows</a>.</p>
<p>In my face book timeline you can see more about things I've done in the past. <br/>
I used to love to build things in electronics.</p>
<p>I have an extra class amateur radio license but I don't do that much with it. I could point someone in the right direction<br/>
though if they were interested in obtaining one. I started with classes from my local radio club.<br/>
Try to find one near you and I'm sure they could help you. Watch your newspapers. </p>
<p>I have an Associate of AS degree in Electricity and Electronics Technology from Kishwaukee College, IL.<br/>
I also had military training in radio repair before that. It was called a Communications 2841 MOS.</p>
